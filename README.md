# Dance-with-Me
IxLab middle project with Albert Han and Wendy Xu. Albert wrote most of the code part.

The project aims to let users play music while dancing (move their feet). We have several directions of keys, so we use chords instead of simple equal temperament, so that people can easily make beautiful songs. 

We use ultrasonic distance sensors, buzzers and cardboard to built it.
